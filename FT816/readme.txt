; FT816.v is an W65C816S software compatible core.
; It is also bus interface similar.
;
; The core is currently under development, but is
; running in an FPGA. 
;
; It is a fairly large core of about 8,000 logic cells.
; 
; The core is broken down into several different files
; which are included from FT816.v
;
; There is an MPU component which encapsulas the FT816
; core and provides chip select decoding and several
