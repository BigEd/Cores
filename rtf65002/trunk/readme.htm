<h1>RTF65002 System</h1>

<p><font color="#FFFF00">I will not be working on the RTF65002 so much anymore;</font> 
it's replaced by the RTF65003.</p>

<p>Check out the RTF65003. It's much the same as the '002 but it has better 
support for byte and 16 bit addressabilty.</p>
<p><font color="#FFCC99">Use at your own risk.</font></p>
<p>The bit file is for an Atlys FPGA board from Digilent.</p>
<p>The video output is setup for a 1366x768 HDMI display, your display device 
must be able to support this mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may have to press the reset button to get the core started.</p>
<p>Press ALT-tab to switch between running tasks.</p>
<p>Pressing 'B' (uppercase B) at the prompt will start TinyBasic as a task. You 
can then ALT-tab over to it.</p>
<p>Pressing 'b' (lowercase b) at the prompt will start EhBASIC as a task. You 
can then ALT-tab over to it.</p>
<p>Pressing '?' at the prompt will display a list of commands.</p>
<p>Pressing CTRL-ALT-DEL will reset the system.</p>
<p>The system may start with an extra '.' after the '$' prompt at startup. Just 
delete it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>On the Atlys board:</h2>
<p>Switch #7 globally disables/enables interrupts. The switch should be set to 
on, or the keyboard won't work.</p>
<p>Swithc #6 globally disables/enables the bitmap display device.</p>
<p>Switches #0 and #1 switch the video display between bitmapped and text mode. 
For text mode both switches should be on.</p>
<p>A Pmod SD can be attached to Port JB pins 1-6.</p>
<p>A PmodTMP can be attached to Port JB pins 7 to 12.</p>
