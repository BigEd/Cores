Cooperative Multi-tasking with FMTK

FMTK can be used in a cooperative multi-tasking fashion by disabling the timer
interrupt and avoiding system functions that rely on timer operation.

Specifically the Sleep() call will not work as it relys on the timer. Also
the WaitMsg() call must have zero passed as the timeout argument which will
cause the function to avoid placing the caller on the timeout list.

Next, to cooperatively yeild processing to another task, the scheduler
interrupt (int #2) must be invoked. This will reschedule the tasks and choose
the next task to run on a priority basis.
