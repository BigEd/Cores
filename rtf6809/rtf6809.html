<h1>RTF6809</h1>

<p>This is a Verilog implementation of the 6809 processor. This implementation 
adds extra features to the 6809 in order to support 32 bit addressing. Many of 
the peripheral softcores I've created depend on 32 bit addressing. The extra 
features include a 32 bit program counter and 32 bit indirect addressing.</p>
<p>A couple of new instructions have been added to support the 32 bit program 
counter addressing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RTF is a far return from subroutine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JSR FAR jumps to a subroutine with a far address, and</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JMP FAR jumps to a far address.</p>
<p>Interrupts store a full 32 bit program counter. The RTI instruction restores 
a 32 bit program counter from the stack.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>FAR prefix</h3>
<p>The FAR prefix has been added as an indicator to use far addresses instead of 
extended addresses. The assembler will automatically output this prefix where 
needed if the indicated address is more than 16 bits. The FAR prefix can be 
applied to extended address mode instructions and also applied for indirect 
addresses.</p>
<p>The following loads a 16 bit value from a text controller located at the 32 
bit address $FFFA0000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LDD&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FAR $FFFA0000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
; load from text controller register</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LDD&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $FFFA0000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
; the assembler will automatically output a FAR prefix</p>
<p>When applied to indirect addresses, the indirect address fetched from memory 
is used as a far address. So a four byte address is fetched from memory in the 
following case:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LDD&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; far [$1000]</p>
<p>ORG $1000</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fcd&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $FFDC0600&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ; 
address of LEDs</p>
<p>Note that indirect addresses must be within the first 64k bank of memory. The 
far prefix does not apply to the address $1000 above, but to the address fetched 
from address $1000 above.</p>
<p>Note also that the assembler can't tell whether or not the address is a far 
address, so the FAR prefix has to be inserted manually in the code where 
required.</p>
<p>The FAR prefix may also be applied to the PSH/PUL instructions to indicate 
that the PC address is four bytes in length, otherwise a PSH/PUL only transfers 
the low order 16 bits of the PC as usual. As mentioned earlier, interrupts and 
the RTI instruction always transfer the full 32 bit program counter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Outer indexed indirect addressing.</h3>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">The Outer Prefix</p>
<p>As further support for 32 bit addressing a new outer indexed indirect 
addressing mode has been added to the processor. This addressing mode is invoked 
using another instruction prefix which is automatically output by the assembler. Outer indexing of a indirect 
address is typically more useful than inner indexing because it allows an 
indexing operation similar to regular indexed addresses.</p>
<p>In outer indexed indirect addressing the index register is applied to the 
address fetched from memory after the indirect address is fetched. Contrasted 
with regular(inner) indexed indirect addressing where the index is applied 
before the indirect address is fetched from memory.</p>
<p>Outer Indexing:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ldd&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [AnAddress],y</p>
<p>An address is fetched from address AnAddress, then Y is added to the fetched 
address to form the final address from which the data is fetched.</p>
<p>Inner Indexing:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ldd&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [AnAddress,y]</p>
<p>An address is fetched from address AnAddress+y which is then used to fetch 
the data.</p>
