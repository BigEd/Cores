<p>Hi, Welcome to the Table888 processor site.</p>
<p>Table888 is a work-in-progress.</p>
<p>Table888 is a 64 bit cpu with 256 general purpose registers. The Table888 book contains more details on the 
processor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Features:</h1>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">- 256 general purpose registers</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">- fixed length 40 bit instructions</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">- load/store architecture , memory 
mapped I/O</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">- two addressing modes - register 
indirect with displacement and indexed</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">- multi-stage non-overlapped pipeline</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Table888 advanced also includes</h3>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">- memory management</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">- segmentation with 16 segment 
registers</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">- paged memory management, with TLB</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">- Triple mode redundancy memory 
access capability (TMR)</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<h1 style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Software:</h1>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">64 bit C Compiler - the C compiler 
hasn't been thoroughly tested yet. It generates what looks like reasonable code.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The compiler is 
coming along nicely. It's been able to compile about 5,000 lines of code without 
problems.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">64 bit assembler - this tool was used 
to build the boot rom.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">A rudimentary DOS is the works. It 
will contain only bare necessities to be able to select a program from SD Card 
to run.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<h1 style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Status:</h1>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">- The processor has been modified to 
support triple mode redundant (TMR) memory access as an option. I was having a 
lot of mysterious problems due to I think my board being partially fried by a 
lightning strike (two of the switches no longer work so maybe an I/O buffer or 
two is shot). So I tried adding TMR and it seems to help.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">- the processor is running a bootrom 
in an FPGA</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">- The system can now boot from SD 
card.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">- the segmentation problem has been 
found and fixed, traced to a reg not being properly initialized. Synthesis 
assumed it'd be a one and optimized out the segmentation setting logic. 
Simulation assumed it'd be a zero.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">- Paging has passed a first test at 
paging. The bootrom was mapped into a high memory area, then accessed with 
memory dump commands to prove it got mapped correctly.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">- The instruction cache needs some 
more work. It seems not to work on occasion. Once again it seems to be working 
in simulation but not in real life.</p>

<h1 style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</h1>

<h1 style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Goals</h1>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">- the boot rom is going to contain 
only some basic stuff needed to boot from the SD card</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Older Goals:</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">- getting the system to boot from SD 
card</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Older Status:</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">- Currently segmentation is not 
completely working, it only seems to work when the registers are initialized to 
a flat memory model. If the base address is non-zero then it doesn't work. But, 
the perplexing problem is that it seems to work fine in simulation (the exact 
same software), so it's going to be a tough one to debug.</p>
